# Data Processing

In our daily life, we deal with lots of **data** but this data is in **raw form**. To provide the data
as the input of ***machine learning algorithms***, we need to convert it into a **meaningful data**.
That is where ***data preprocessing*** comes into picture. In other simple words, we can say
that before providing the data to the machine learning algorithms we need to preprocess
the data.
